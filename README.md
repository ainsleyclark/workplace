# üëç Workplace

An extremely simple Facebook Workplace client for sending transmissions to threads via Go.

## Install

```
go get -u github.com/ainsleyclark/workplace
```

## Quick Start

See below for a quick start to create a new Workplace client and sending off a transmission. For more details please
see [Go Doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ainsleyclark/workplace) which includes information on all types.

```go
func Example() error {
	// Create as new Workplace client.
	wp, err := workplace.New(workplace.Config{Token: "my-token"})
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Create a new Workplace Transmission that contains
	// the thread ID and message to be sent to the thread.
	tx := workplace.Transmission{
		Thread:  "thread-id",
		Message: "message",
	}

	// Send the transmission to the workplace API.
	err = wp.Notify(tx)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return nil
}
```

## Roadmap

- Add all workplace graph endpoints from [Facebook Endpoints](https://github.com/fbsamples/workplace-platform-samples/blob/main/SampleAPIEndpoints/Postman/Workplace_Graph_Collection.json)
